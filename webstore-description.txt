FLoC, short for Federated Learning of Cohorts, is the new algorithm used by Google Chrome to group users into buckets based on their interests. You can read more about it here: https://web.dev/floc, and why Brave and some other browsers have blocked it here: https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/. 

If you HAVE to use Chrome, this extension is a simple way to prevent FLoC from divulging your "cohort id" to websites. You can also consider using DuckDuckGo's extension for this plus other privacy protections: https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/
